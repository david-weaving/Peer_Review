For the first product, I would implement some sort of password to go along with making an account, as anyone can login with anyoneâ€™s ID. This could be a little complex with seeing how to hash the passwords to ensure they're as secure as possible.You would have to
add a password field to your users table. You would also need to update authentication flow looking at password attempts.

For the second product, I would look at implementing something to log all the time spent on a movie and also when a movie isn't finished, to track the time they stopped out so they can pick up at that time again. This could also be a little troublesome, 
as the user would have to log the time. But it would help people pick up where they left off on their movies. You would have to update your schema as well as change your set up for joining tables.
